PLAN:

1) change menu to responsive, mobile menu with working nested links

2) change plugin for slider to a javascript/jquery tool that works on mobile/tablets

3) re-write "project" loop display
		- picture
		- site name
		- site description
		- "see more" button
		- vertically arranged

// do I need to go into some "site-origin" file to figure out how to access data??? not sure what the siteorigin_setting() method outputs...

draw up a physical sketch, then put it in gimp, then make it
