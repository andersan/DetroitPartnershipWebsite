PLAN:


HOME PAGE/NAV
1) change menu to responsive, mobile menu with working nested links --------DONE... dropdown links dont work properly, but we can change the way they are organized in the wordpress admin area...

2) change plugin for slider to a javascript/jquery tool that works on mobile/tablets --- DONE... settled for Bootstrap Carousel. NOTE: not accessible, hard for people with screen readers...

3) re-write "project" loop display
		- picture
		- site name
		- site description
		- "see more" button
		- vertically arranged
		*************** TODO *********** : could just change the buttons that move the projects?? current display on main page is fine, but hard to navigate on mobile...
		
OTHER:
Update plugins
Remove previous slider plugin
Improve weekly program signup
	-include number of open spots (draw from google sheets)

Blog not yet mobile
Improve dimensions on main page (for different views)

// do I need to go into some "site-origin" file to figure out how to access data??? not sure what the siteorigin_setting() method outputs...
